# Vulnerabilities

This lab was not instructive whatsoever. There were no "vulnerabilities" that we were exploiting specifically other than a highly vulnerable test machine. 

So, unfortunately, there is not one specific vulnerability that I can point to here. 

I'm not sure what it is we were trying to learn here. This lab was horrific.

# Mitigation

The mitigation of the afforementioned "vulnerability" would be to not use a highly vulnerable machine in real-world settings.
