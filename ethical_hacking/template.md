# Documentation

You may want to preface each screen shot or group of screen shots with a
short description.

Attach screen shots or other documentation for **ALL** of the work that
you perform in the lab exercise.

* This documentation is a record of the work that you performed.

* This documentation is how you prove that a particular vulnerability
  exits.

* This documentation describes how you can recreate the vulnerability.

* You may need to refer to documentation from previous labs, to help
  you discover vulnerabilities in later labs.

# Vulnerabilities

## Vulnerability 01

### Description

In non-technical terms, describe the risk for each vulnerability that
you discover. If you discover more than one vulnerability in the lab
exercise, add a "Vulnerability \#\#" section for each vulnerability.

### Relative Risk (High, Medium, Low)

Rank the risk according to the amount of money needed to mitigate the
vulnerability.

* Low

    * can be accomplished within the existing IT budget

    * no additional budget request required

    * for example: \<= \$1,000 for a medium to large company?

* Medium

    * Approximately 10 times more expensive than a "low" risk

    * additional budget request may be required

    * for example: between \$1,000 and \$10,000 for a medium to large
      company?

* High

    * Approximately 10 times more expensive than a "medium" risk

    * additional budget request is definitely required

    * for example: between \$1,000 and \$10,000 for a medium to large
      company?

### Mitigation

Describe the mitigation for this risk.

Describe the residual risk.

RUBRICS:

Text in red describe the kind of information that should be included in
a particular section. Please replace the RUBRICS with black text.

Note:

If you do not discover any vulnerabilities in a particular lab, enter
"No vulnerabilities discovered in this lab." under the "Vulnerabilities"
heading, and delete the remaining subheadings.
