**Note:** Wireshark menus now do not have the same options as the instructions. Because of this, it is not clear how to set it up as instructed. Because of this and because I am not familiar with WireShark, I skipped this step.

# Vulnerabilities

In this lab, we _created_ the vulnerability by opening a backdoor into the Windows 7 VM. This is not something that can be mitigated because we had the proper permissions on the Windows 7 VM to be able to do this.

The backdoor was closed after completing this exercise.
