# Vulnerabilities

## Vulnerability 01

### Description

In non-technical terms, describe the risk for each vulnerability that
you discover. If you discover more than one vulnerability in the lab
exercise, add a "Vulnerability \#\#" section for each vulnerability.

### Relative Risk (High, Medium, Low)

Rank the risk according to the amount of money needed to mitigate the
vulnerability.

* Low

    * can be accomplished within the existing IT budget

    * no additional budget request required

    * for example: \<= \$1,000 for a medium to large company?

* Medium

    * Approximately 10 times more expensive than a "low" risk

    * additional budget request may be required

    * for example: between \$1,000 and \$10,000 for a medium to large
      company?

* High

    * Approximately 10 times more expensive than a "medium" risk

    * additional budget request is definitely required

    * for example: between \$1,000 and \$10,000 for a medium to large
      company?
