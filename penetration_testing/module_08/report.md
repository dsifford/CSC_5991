# Documentation

Make sure you include all pertinent information that you find in your lab
report. This is the documentation that you will need to substantiate the
vulnerabilities that you describe in the summary penetration report after
completing all the labs.

While you do not need screen shots of everything that you do, you do need to
document everything that you do. For example, you might do a scan of all the
open ports on a server, sending the results to a file. You may then do a “grep”
of the file showing all the active ports. You should capture the results of the
“grep”, which may be a few screen shots. You do not need to capture screen shots
for the complete scan.

Some information that you find may not seem important now, but could prove
useful as you continue your testing. For this reason, you should be as thorough
as possible in documenting your work.

You should add descriptive captions to your screen shots. This will help you to
remember the specifics of each screen shot.

A well-documented lab report is important for the following reasons:

*   This documentation is a record of the work that you performed.
*   This documentation is how you prove that a particular vulnerability exits.
*   This documentation describes how you can recreate the vulnerability.

# Vulnerabilities

Note: If you do not discover any vulnerabilities in a particular lab, enter “No
vulnerabilities discovered in this lab.” under the “Vulnerabilities” heading,
and delete the remaining subheadings.

## Vulnerability 01

### Description

Describe each vulnerability that you discover as a separate entry. Provide
enough detail so that someone reading your lab report can understand the
vulnerability.

### Risk

The risk associated with this vulnerability depends on the impact to the
organization that owns this network. Since neither the organization that owns
this network, nor the manner in which the organization uses the network, has
been identified, we can’t accurately identify the risk.

However, you should make an attempt to identify the risk of each vulnerability.

Here is one process for calculating risk magnitude:

*   Calculate the impact if the vulnerability is breached on a 1 to 10 scale
    (where 1 equals the least severe or least probable impact and 10 equals the
    most severe or most probable impact).
*   Calculate the probability that the vulnerability is breached on a 1 to 10
    scale (where 1 equals extremely unlikely to occur and 10 equals almost
    certain to occur).
*   Risk magnitude is calculated by multiplying the impact by the probability.

### Mitigation

Describe the mitigation for this risk.

Describe the residual risk.

## Vulnerability 02
