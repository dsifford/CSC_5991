# Vulnerabilities

Note: If you do not discover any vulnerabilities in a particular lab, enter “No
vulnerabilities discovered in this lab.” under the “Vulnerabilities” heading,
and delete the remaining subheadings.

## Vulnerability 01

### Description

Describe each vulnerability that you discover as a separate entry. Provide
enough detail so that someone reading your lab report can understand the
vulnerability.

### Risk

The risk associated with this vulnerability depends on the impact to the
organization that owns this network. Since neither the organization that owns
this network, nor the manner in which the organization uses the network, has
been identified, we can’t accurately identify the risk.

However, you should make an attempt to identify the risk of each vulnerability.

Here is one process for calculating risk magnitude:

*   Calculate the impact if the vulnerability is breached on a 1 to 10 scale
    (where 1 equals the least severe or least probable impact and 10 equals the
    most severe or most probable impact).
*   Calculate the probability that the vulnerability is breached on a 1 to 10
    scale (where 1 equals extremely unlikely to occur and 10 equals almost
    certain to occur).
*   Risk magnitude is calculated by multiplying the impact by the probability.

### Mitigation

Describe the mitigation for this risk.

Describe the residual risk.
