## Lab 01: Vulnerability Assessment Using SAINT

This lab is extremely similar or even identical to a lab that we covered in
Ethical Hacking.

The goal of this lab is to run a full scan of a highly vulnerable system using
SAINT.

This lab walks us through the SAINT system, and instructs on what boxes to check
when quering up a new report and after the report has ran, it shows us how to
save our data as charts and graphs.

I have not included screenshots here because the screenshots in the book are
identical to the ones that I would be providing. So if needed, reference the lab
book.

The results we get back from the report are exhaustively detailed and outline
every known vulnerability of the system (which, on this specific system is in
the hundreds).

There are no specific vulnerabilities to note here, other than the system owner
should never, ever run a metasplotable system in production.

# Vulnerabilities

## Vulnerability 01

User is running a highly vulnerable-on-purpose test machine.

### Description

This specific machine is vulnerable for the sake of being vulnerable in every
way imagineable. There is nothing specific here to note, other than the user
should absolutely not be using this test system in production.

### Risk

**Impact:** 10/10

**Probability:** 10/10

**Magnitude:** 1.0

### Mitigation

Stop using this system immediately and use a more secure production system.
