## Lab 01: Creating a Virus Using the JPS Virus Maker Tool

This lab walks us through some of the options of JPS Virus Maker. There are no
specific tasks that needed to be completed.

In this exercise, students are shown some of the many dozens of options that JPS
provides and how/when/why a hacker might use them. All the options are
enabled/disabled using checkboxes, so producing an effective virus with this
program could literally be performed by chimpanzees (which I find sort of
scary!).

There is nothing of importance to note here that can't also be found in the JPS
User Manual or Lab Guide.

## Lab 02: Virus Analysis Using IDA

This lab walks us through a very basic demo of the IDA debugger program on
Windows. In this exercise, we load a prebuilt "virus" called `face.exe` into the
program and look at it from a macro perspective using the different views that
the application provides (`Hex`, `structures`, `Enums`, `function calls`, and
`flow chart`)

There are no specific vulnerabilities to be noted here as we did not begin to
deeply deconstruct the `face.exe` program. The goal of this lab was just to give
the student a general idea of what the IDA application is and does from a very
high level.
